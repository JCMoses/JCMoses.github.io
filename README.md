## Projects
### Logistics and Production Analytics Dashboard

Explorartory analytics project for customer logistics and production data. Goal was to display requested details in a custom dashboard application. The app was required to be clear and simple to read information, allow for users to toggle to a "dark mode". Year-on-year metrics changes were displayed, with status of current year relative to previous indicated by colour. Production changes at different plants over time was also displayed, as well as the top clients by volume and top products by volume for the selected time-period.

### Sales Forecasting on Email Analytics Data

For this project, the requirement was to provide a useful forecast of the future sales of an online store, to enable management to better plan inventories, staff requirements, and forecasted revenue. Daily data was used, which enabled good forecasts around sales and other marketing events. It also enabled management to see which days were more effective for sales and marketing events. Forecasting was conducted using a variety of different machine learning (including deep) algorithms, combining the best into weighted ensembles for greater accuracy. Data pipelines and ML pipelines were created to make the analysis repeatable and able to be updated with new data. The analysis was undertaken in **R** with some **Python** also used for the deep learning algorithms.

### Email Lead Scoring with Forecasting

This project involved classifying leads into categories based on a forecast likelihood of purchasing in the future. The initial business case was to separate the leads who are more likely to purchase from others, but with additional data analytics, it was found that a different strategy would nurture the less likely leads into those who were more likely to make purchases. This would reduce churn significantly, increasing sales. This project required analytical analysis of data, classification using various machine learning algorithms, and forecasting of future sales under different conditions. Data and ML pipelines were created to enable the analysis to be revisited with new data periodically. The Analysis was undertake using **Python**.

### Stock Market Edge Analysis

Traders require “edge” in order to consistently make money in the stock market. This project involved looking for different sources of edge and confirming / disproving their continued existence in the market. Different assets were analysed and back-tested against known sources of edge. Comparisons were made against benchmarks (SPY, 80/20 portfolio) and each edge was assessed for improvement over the benchmarks, max. drawdown size, and other statistics. This analysis was undertaken using the **R** language.


### Construction Project Risk Management Dashboard

This project was developed in order to better manage project-based risks for construction industry projects for a consulting engineering office. The major requirements were to enable a fast, easy way of adding, adjusting, importing and exporting risk assessments for projects. These should be easily visualised, with any areas of concern identified at a glance. The overall concentration of risks in different areas should also be visualised. It was also important that all risks could be easily exported to excel, and also imported so that details can be easily shared and incorporated quickly into the dashboard.
The dashboard and analysis was written in **R** and **Shiny**.

### Customer Segmentation Project
[Code](https://github.com/RandomJeff1/Customer_Segmentation)

Imported the dataset from SQLite and analysed it to differentiate different kinds of customers using  **R**. The business question for this project was **"Can we predict if a customer will make a new purchase within 90 days?"** A data-driven approach led to better characterization of the different customers by analysing different kinds of variables to assist the classification model. The project was written up using R Markdown to allow for the work to be properly documented and repeatable. The results were presented in a **Shiny** app, which allowed the user to view characteristics of each customer, along with the likelihood of them making a new purchase within 90 days. A user can also select customers based on a strong likelihood of a new purchase in that timeframe to view their profile.

### Sales Prediction for next 90 days
[Code](https://github.com/RandomJeff1/Nested_Timeseries)

The business requirement for this project was clear: **Predict weekly sales for the next 90 days** for each of the datasets. This enables the business to prepare / order sufficient stock to meet the expected requirements. The goal is to improve ordering to reduce waste by over-ordering, and also to meet demand by ordering enough.
This project was written in **R** and **R Markdown** and a report  has been generated in html format outlining the process.
